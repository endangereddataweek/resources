## What should I know before I get started?

### Code of Conduct

This project adheres to the Contributor Covenant [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

Please report unacceptable behavior to [blocke@msu.edu](blocke@msu.edu) and/or [jason@jasonheppler.org](mailto:jason@jasonheppler.org).

### Endangered Data Week

Endangered Data Week is a collaborative effort coordinated across campuses, nonprofits, libraries, citizen science initiatives, and cultural heritage institutions to shed light on public datasets that are in danger of being deleted, repressed, mishandled, or lost. The week's events can promote care for endangered collections by: publicizing the availability of datasets; increasing critical engagement with them, including through visualization and analysis; and by encouraging political activism for open data policies and the fostering of data skills through workshops on curation, documentation and discovery, improved access, and preservation.

This repository specifically hosts **Endangered Data Week resources**, designed to provide information about workshops, flyers, and promotional material. Other repositories currently include:

- the [Endangered Data Week website](https://github.com/endangereddataweek/endangereddataweek.org)

## How Can I Contribute?

### Your First Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Endangered Data Week? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

* [Beginner issues][beginner] - issues which should only require a few lines of code or writing.
* [Help wanted issues][help-wanted] - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

### Submitting Workshop Material

We're eager to help people work with data, and eagerly welcome contributions of workshop material that others can reuse and remix. This section guides you through submitting a workshop for Endangered Data Week, with a focus on brand new materials. Please use these guidelines to help the project leads and the community understand your suggestions.

#### How Do I Submit A Workshop?

Workshops won't always be tracked as [Github issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/), and we're fine with duplicate workshops as long as there's some level of difference between them. To generate new workshop material, you can follow these steps:

* **Fork this repository** to your own Github account.
* **Create a new folder** for your workshop. Following the other naming conventions for workshops by prepending a folder name with `workshop-`. If there's a folder with the same name as your folder, append your last name or institution (for example, `workshop-data-science-uno`).
* **Place your workshop material in this folder** with some light structuring, including: slides, data, code, images, or other supporting material that might be needed. However, if your slides are already hosted elsewhere (like Google), you can skip this step and move to the next one.
* **Place a README.md in your folder** that explains: the title of the workshop; a short description of the workshops goals; a general sense of experience levels for those attending the workshop; and a point-of-contact for those involved in creating the workshop. If you're linking to a workshop hosted elsewhere, place a link to the slides/material within this README.
* **Once your material is ready** send us a [pull request](#pull-request) to notify us that changes need review.
* **You're done!** If we have questions for you or need more information, we may deny the pull request and ask for more details.

### Telling Your Data Stories

We want to hear your stories about how data that becomes endangered, threatened, neglected, or lost impacts your work. We're collecting your data stories, which are written contributions that can be as short as a couple sentences or as long as a couple pages. If you have a data story to share (or several!), here's how to do it:

* **Fork this repository** to your own Github account.
* **Find the `data-stories` repository** in this repo. Inside should be a collection of individual Markdown files.
* **Create a new Markdown file** either in [Github's interface](https://help.github.com/articles/about-writing-and-formatting-on-github/) or on your own machine. 
* **Write your data story** in this new file. Your text here can be as long or as short as you'd like. And remember to sign it by placing your name (and institution, if you'd like) at the bottom of the file. Please sign your document this way:

> lastName: Heppler
> displayName: Jason Heppler
> institution: University of Nebraska
> url: https://example.com/edw

* **Save the document** and send us a [pull request](#pull-request) with `Data Stories` in the submission title.
* **You're done!** We'll review the pull request once we recieve it, and get back to you with any questions we might have.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for Endangered Data Week, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion :pencil: and find related suggestions :mag_right:.

Before creating enhancement suggestions, please check [this list](#before-submitting-an-enhancement-suggestion) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating an enhancement suggestion, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion). Fill in [the template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md), including the steps that you imagine you would take if the feature you're requesting existed.

#### Before Submitting An Enhancement Suggestion

* **Determine [which repository the enhancement should be suggested in](#endangered-data-week).**
* **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=+is%3Aissue+user%3Aendangered+data+week)** to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After you've determined [which repository](#endangered-data-week) your enhancement suggestion is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, as [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.
* **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to Endangered Data Week.
* **List some other events or applications where this enhancement exists.**
