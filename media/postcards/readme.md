Brief instructions for printing these:

- The PDF file is set up for 2-sided printing on letter-landscape paper.
- Use ‘short edge’ binding on digital printer/copier for correct image imposition.
- Cut printed sheets first into quarters along center lines (4.25 x 5.5) then trim outer margins of each card to the edge of the printed image.
- Trimmed cards will measure ~4.0625 x 5.3125” (4 1/16 x 5 5/16 inches).
